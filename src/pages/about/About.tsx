              Rail Werks Brewing Depot is a family-run business, literally.
              Husband and wife team, William and Denise Roberts, head up the
              crew. Our daughter Rebecca Schultz, provides marketing and social
              media experience. And our son Ben, being 14, is just along for the
              ride.
            </p>

            <p>
              Coming soon, we will bring a brewery/restaurant experience of the
              likes Minnesota has never seen. We will feature rotating craft
              brews, smokin’ BBQ and a large indoor space for year round
              activities. Snow will never get in the way of the fun.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are very excited about this venture. We would love to tell you
              more about the business in a one-on-one phone call or in person
              meeting. In the meantime, visit our{" "}

                  William has been a home brewer for over six years. Starting
                  with a simple kit he bought just for fun and soon found he had
                  a knack for brewing. William quickly advanced through the
                  learning curve and developed a passion for experimenting with
                  different styles and ingredients. Thanks to the patience of
                  his loving wife Denise, William’s brewing equipment grew just
                  like his love for beer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  BBQ got into William’s blood stream over 20 years ago. William
                  and Denise have worked over the years to create their own
                  homemade rubs and sauces to perfect their BBQ style. With a
                  home collection of 5 different smokers (one home made out of
                  an old refrigerator) he believes everything taste better
                  coming out of a smoker.

              William has been a home brewer for over six years. Starting with a
              simple kit he bought just for fun and soon found he had a knack
              for brewing. William quickly advanced through the learning curve
              and developed a passion for experimenting with different styles
              and ingredients. Thanks to the patience of his loving wife Denise,
              William's brewing equipment grew just like his love for beer.

              BBQ got into William's blood stream over 20 years ago. William and
              Denise have worked over the years to create their own homemade
              rubs and sauces to perfect their BBQ style. With a home collection
              of 5 different smokers (one home made out of an old refrigerator)
              he believes everything taste better coming out of a smoker.
